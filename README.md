# AIS

Trying out parsing AIS messages myself, while learning Go. 

With time, this could become a library. 

For now, use it as you please.

Thanks to [Eric S. Raymond](https://github.com/eric-s-raymond) for documenting the protocol: [AIVDM/AIVDO protocol decoding](http://www.catb.org/gpsd/AIVDM.html)
